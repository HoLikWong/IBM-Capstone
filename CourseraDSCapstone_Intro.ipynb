    "Jakarta is the capital of Indonesia with a population of 10,5 million, and is the heart of the second densest metropolitan area in the world behind Tokyo, Japan. Having hosted ASEAN games recently back in 2018, it has witnessed heavy investment in transportational infrastructure with the opening of the first MRT line in Indonesia just this year.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given that, the city will surely see more growth of which information regarding the lay of the land will be invaluable for investors and entrepreneurs to make strategic decision for investment or choosing locations for business operation.\n",

    "This project will attempt to explore patterns of subdistricts within Jakarta by categorizing them into clusters in order to identify existing trends within neighborhoods of Jakarta. From there on, recommendations can be made on which category of neighborhood will be most suitable for a certain type of venue to be opened.\n",
    "\n",
    "The result of this project is aimed at general entrepreneur but may be most useful for entrepreneurs on the food and beverage sector given that location can be the deciding factor for a success.\n",

    "Venue queries will then be made by subdistricts using FourSquare APIs. The resulting data regarding venue category will be used to observe commonality between subdistricts. The commonality clusters can then provide insight on which type of venue will thrive better on which cluster. K-means clustering algorithm will be used to find pattern between the subdistricts.\n",
